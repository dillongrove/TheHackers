Welcome to The Hackers!
<br/>
Some things to note before getting started:
<br/><br/>
The ultimate goal is to complete your 'hack' before the other team.
<br/>
To get to work, apply players to tasks on the chart by left-clicking or using the 1, 2, 3, 4 keys.
<br/>
Try matching hackers to same task colors as their expertise; they'll work faster as a result.
<br/>
As you complete task nodes on the chart, more will appear.
<br/>
Be careful which tasks you choose: while some tasks move you forward, some can be dead ends.
<br/>
As your hackers work, they'll lose energy and might fall asleep on the job, watch out!
<br/>
Food will arrive when you reach the 'Minimum Viable Product' node. Hooray!
<br/>
Remember to feed your team at this time so they can finish more tasks.
<br/>
Be quick though, if you're not fast enough, the other team may snatch up all the food before you.
<br/><br/>
Your hackers have three traits that help them perform at hackathons: productivity, teamwork and focus.
<br/>
More productive hackers finish tasks quickly,
<br/>
while hackers with higher teamwork work with other hackers to finish the same task faster.
<br/>
Finally, hackers with high focus will finish tasks faster when constantly assigned to work without being distracted by other tasks.
<br/><br/>
The goal is to reach the end node of the hack before the other team.
<br/>
Manage your hackers wisely, move quickly, and build amazing things!
