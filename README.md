TheHackers
==========

"The Hackers" is a real time strategy game where you can compete with your friends in a simulated Hackathon.  You can choose four hackers for your team, and then beat your opponent by completing the hack before they do.  To complete a hack, simply task your hackers on a task "node" by clicking them, then clicking on a node.  Keep in mind that hackers work much faster within their specialization (programmers work fast on programming nodes, etc.).  Be careful you don't work them too hard though--your hackers will run out of energy and fall asleep if you don't keep them nourished with food or drink!

This game was built over a 24 hour period by [Dillon Grove](www.github.com/dillongrove), [Scott Martin](www.github.com/smartin015), [Todd Medema](www.toddmedema.com), and [Sara Ladley](http://saraladley.com/#/0) at the Facebook World Hackathon Finals in Menlo Park, California.  We took 4th place with this game.

The back end of "THe Hackers" is built using Python on Google AppEngine.  The front-end is written in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, with the generous help of many art assets created in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
