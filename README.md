TheHackers
==========

"The Hackers" is a real time strategy game where you can compete with your friends in a simulated Hackathon.  You can choose four hackers for your team, and then beat your opponent by completing the hack before they do.  To complete a hack, simply task your hackers on a task "node" by clicking them, then clicking on a node.  Keep in mind that hackers work much faster within their specialization (programmers work fast on programming nodes, etc.).  Be careful you don't work them too hard though--your hackers will run out of energy and fall asleep if you don't keep them nourished with food or drink!
